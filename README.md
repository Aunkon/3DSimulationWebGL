# 3DSimulationWebGL
# Game Features and Controlling
1. Automatically at first the  API called and generate the nodes and connected to the root nodes. There are n boxes without counting the root. display the data get from the API top right corner as {"boxes": n} formatting.
2. Every node including the root is draggable and the connector will auto-resize according to the root and the dragged nodes.
3. You can Navigate the Camera using Keyboard - WASD key and Look around with right-click + rotating the Mouse.
4. By clicking refresh you can respawn the nodes from the provided information of API.

# Research and Development.
1. This is the first time I use GitHub. Basically I use Tortoise svn for version control.
2. Find Boxes Dragging and re-scaling using drag on online. But finally, figure it out by myself.
3. Other small parts of this project's I was experienced with my professional life.

# Integration.
1. First I create a GitHub Repository.
2. Then start to collect every resource I find online for this project.
3. Try to Design a solution to solve this in my mind.
